The POM is configured to build with specific versions of HBase and Hadoop. If your versions differ from those in the POM, you can override the versions by passing hbaseVersion and hadooopVersion. For example:

mvn -DhbaseVersion=0.90.6 -DhadoopVersion=0.20.2

The main build artifact jar has a classifier of the form hbase${hbaseVersion}-hadoop${hadoopVersion}, so you can depend on it in another project by doing something like:

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.urbanairship</groupId>
  <artifactId>datacube</artifactId>
  <version>${datacube.version}</version>
  <classifier>hbase0.94.0-hadoop1.0.3</classifier>
</dependency>
